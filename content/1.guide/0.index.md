For optimal outcomes, we recommend uploading images featuring a single individual with consistent attire and style.
- **Clean background**: Ensure that the background is clean, and pay attention to the lighting in each photo.
- **Single Subject**: We recommend uploading images with only one full body.
- **Consistent Style**: Ensure that the subject in the image maintains the same style.
- **Uniform Attire**: It is important to have the subject in the image dressed in a consistent attire.
